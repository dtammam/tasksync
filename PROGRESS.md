- 2026-31-01 19:29 - Added git hooks (pre-commit: web lint/check/test + rust fmt/clippy; pre-push: web tests + Playwright smoke + server tests), set core.hooksPath, documented in README

- 2026-31-01 20:34 - Built My Day + List UI (Svelte) with sidebar, task rows, stores, seed data; added list route, new Vitest + Playwright coverage; lint/check/test/Playwright passing
- 2026-31-01 23:22 - Added IDB persistence for lists/tasks (repo layer, hydration on mount, fake-indexeddb for tests); Playwright/Vitest/lint passing and merged to main

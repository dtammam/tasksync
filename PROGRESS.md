- 2026-31-01 19:13 - Initialized repo scaffolding (docs/AGENTS.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, web/ SvelteKit app with lint/test config, server/ Axum stub, shared/types/task.ts, root tool configs)
- 2026-31-01 19:13 - Ran npm audit (dev deps show 3 low from cookie in @sveltejs/kit/adapter-auto); rust toolchain not available (rustc missing)
- 2026-31-01 19:14 - Installed Rust toolchain (rustc 1.93.0), ran cargo fmt/clippy/test for tasksync-server (all ok)
- 2026-31-01 19:19 - Added GitHub Actions CI (web lint/check/test + Playwright install/run, server fmt/clippy/test); prepared workflows directory
- 2026-31-01 19:25 - Tightened .gitignore (logs, Playwright test-results, turbo/cache) for dependency noise
- 2026-31-01 19:29 - Added git hooks (pre-commit: web lint/check/test + rust fmt/clippy; pre-push: web tests + Playwright smoke + server tests), set core.hooksPath, documented in README
- 2026-31-01 19:33 - Added licenses (MIT/Apache-2.0), editorconfig, SECURITY/CONTRIBUTING, .env.example, CODEOWNERS, PR template; CI caches for npm/cargo
- 2026-31-01 19:35 - Updated docs/AGENTS.md with hook/lint discipline, commit hygiene, security notes
- 2026-31-01 19:39 - Enforced test rule in AGENTS: every new component/module needs unit + functional/e2e tests (Vitest/Playwright or Rust)
- 2026-31-01 20:34 - Built My Day + List UI (Svelte) with sidebar, task rows, stores, seed data; added list route, new Vitest + Playwright coverage; lint/check/test/Playwright passing
- 2026-31-01 23:22 - Added IDB persistence for lists/tasks (repo layer, hydration on mount, fake-indexeddb for tests); Playwright/Vitest/lint passing and merged to main
- 2026-31-01 23:50 - Added run-command guidance to AGENTS (one-liner env for server/web/Playwright/tests)
- 2026-31-01 23:55 - Server foundation pushed (SQLite migrations, list/task routes, path fixes); local server + web tests confirmed
- 2026-02-01 00:32 - Client API sync bootstrap (env-driven headers, fetch lists/tasks from server into stores/IDB)
- 2026-01-02 00:49 - Added client push of dirty task toggles (store dirty flag, sync helpers, layout triggers), seeded default space/users/lists via server/src/bin/seed.rs
- 2026-01-02 09:31 - Offline task creation: new add forms, local task flagging/push-to-server, sync merge of unsynced tasks, seed server lists to match client, added unit + Playwright coverage
- 2026-01-02 15:13 - Added helper scripts (scripts/1-seed.ps1, 2-serve.ps1, 3-web.ps1) for one-line setup/run on Windows terminals
- 2026-01-02 15:25 - Fixed helper scripts to use absolute DATABASE_URL and create data dir before seed/run
- 2026-02-01 13:16 - Filtered legacy seed task IDs out of push flow (skip non-server IDs, drop 404s) and added sync unit tests; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 14:05 - Stopped task re-seeding on hydrate (no refresh dupes); added store hydration test; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 14:09 - Sequenced sync to pull → push → pull, ensuring freshly pushed tasks persist server IDs before refresh; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 14:18 - Forced sync writes to await IDB persistence after pull/push to avoid re-pushing locals on fast refresh; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 14:56 - Cleared IDB stores before saves to avoid stale local task records causing duplicate pushes; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 14:59 - Local dirty tasks now win over remote copies during pull (prevents checked-off tasks flipping back to pending); added coverage; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 15:02 - Confirmed no dupes and status stays after refresh; ready for next tasks
- 2026-02-01 15:06 - Removed legacy client seed tasks (app starts empty; server seed only) and updated README; web lint/check/test passing
- 2026-02-01 15:07 - Fully removed unused seed wiring from tasks store; tests/lint/check still green
- 2026-02-01 15:28 - Stabilized Playwright e2e without client seeds (state reset + unique titles); all browsers passing

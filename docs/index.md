# docs/

## Execution plans (for non-trivial work)

- Active plans: `exec-plans/active/`
- Completed plans: `exec-plans/completed/`
- Tech debt tracker: `exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`

## References (agent-facing)

- Command formatting rules: `references/command-style.md`
- Prompt templates: `references/agent-prompts.md`
- Repo conventions: `references/repo-conventions.md`

## Generated artifacts
